I am hard working when it comes to domestic tasks but am easy going with the standards of cleanliness and am happy to adapt to the status quo. I also enjoy fun and edgy conversation.

I'm very clean and considerate and I have excellent taste in entertainment. Liberal and open-minded. In a nut shell, I like quiet houses where people recycle, turn of the lights when they leave a room, clean up after themselves, and don't make me feel like I need to fear for my personal safety.
